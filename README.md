## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Download and install latest version of Python from the official website: python.org
- Download Postman from the official website: postman.com/downloads/

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <project_directory>
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```
   Windows:
   ```bash
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
   Mac:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the migrations to set up the database:
   ```bash
   python3 manage.py migrate
   ```

5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   python3 manage.py runserver
   ```

## Testing with Postman

You can use Postman to test the API endpoints. Hereâ€™s how:

### Step 1: Open Postman

1. Launch Postman application.

### Step 2: Testing Add Points

1. Set the method to `POST`.
2. Enter the URL: `http://localhost:8000/points/add`
3. Go to the **Body** tab.
4. Select **raw** and choose **JSON** from the dropdown.
5. Enter the request body in JSON format.
6. Click **Send**.

### Step 3: Testing Spend Points

1. Set the method to `POST`.
2. Enter the URL: `http://localhost:8000/points/spend`
3. Go to the **Body** tab.
4. Select **raw** and choose **JSON** from the dropdown.
5. Enter the request body in JSON format (specify the points to spend).
6. Click **Send**.

### Step 4: Testing Get Balance

1. Set the method to `GET`.
2. Enter the URL: `http://localhost:8000/points/balance`
3. Click **Send**.

## Clearing the Database for Retesting
If you want to clear your database to start fresh for retesting, you can follow these steps:

1. First exit out of the development server by:
- Pressing `Ctrl + C` on your keyboard. This will terminate the server process.

2. Clear the database
    ```bash
      python3 manage.py flush
    ```
- This command will remove all data from the database while keeping the database schema intact.
- You will be prompted to confirm this action by typing "yes".

## Exiting the Server and Virtual Environment,
To stop the development server running on your terminal, simply:
- Press `Ctrl + C` on your keyboard. This will terminate the server process.

To deactivate the virtual environment, run:
```bash
deactivate
```
This command will return you to your system's default environment.

### Notes

- Make sure your server is running before making requests.
